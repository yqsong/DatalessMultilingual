a, impersonal pronoun used as 
Eng. 'one' or 'they,' French 
' on ' ; antafi one has gone, 
anakiranka they are calling 
you, anadarita they are 
laughing at me. Cf. Gram, 
p. 39 ; possibly the a which 
is the prefix to the passive 
voice ought to be regarded 
as this impersonal pronoun. 

a is used as a prefix to denote 
the passive voice of the per- 
fect, dependent past and pre- 
sent tenses when used with 
a negative, e.g. ba akoreshi ba 
he was not driven out, ba 
azua da shi he is not being 
brought. A long emphasized 
a is used to denote the future 
of the passive voice, e.g. dka- 
sheshi he will be killed. A 
short a is used to denote the 
imperative mood of the pas- 
sive voice, e.g. akoreshi let 
him be driven out.

in the Sokoto dialect in place 
of ke. It is used with all per-

it, kai (fern, ke) shi (fem. ita), 
mu, ku, su addashi. It some- 
times follows a noun directly, 
e.g. kura addashi the hyena 
has it. It is also used with 
nan, e.g. gari annan; cf. also

man, shi addaidai it is all 
right, shi assarikinrmi he is 
our king, shi a abokinmu he

Its length is about three feet. 
During the dry season the

and according to the Hausa 
tradition eats its own tail.

cretes fat in its tail which 
supplies sufficient nourisli- 
ment for five or six months ; 
cf . similar use of fat in camel's

it lines with a protecting coat 
of hardened mucus. When

takes to the water again. Its 
skeleton is notochordal, and 
a single vertical fin surrounds 
the posterior part of the body.

to leave a wound ; for de-
